/**
 * A component that is used to build a ProcessorTopology. A topology contains an acyclic graph of sources, processors, and sinks. A source is a node in the graph that consumes one or more Kafka topics and forwards them to its child nodes. A processor is a node in the graph that receives input records from upstream nodes, processes that records, and optionally forwarding new records to one or all of its children. Finally, a sink is a node in the graph that receives records from upstream nodes and writes them to a Kafka topic. This builder allows you to construct an acyclic graph of these nodes, and the builder is then passed into a new KafkaStreams instance that will then begin consuming, processing, and producing records
